# Summary:
# - Collect all open issues
# - Filter by check/issue
# - CheckA

# This script at the moment performs Subcheck A only
# SubCheck AA: Verify that now all files have the .vba extension and no longer have the .vb extension (.vbs for check B).
# SubCheck AB: Verify if the user intentionally left files with the .vb extension (.vbs for check B) in the repository.
